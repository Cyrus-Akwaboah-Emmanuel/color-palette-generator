**Overview**
This is a Color Palette Generator project done using HTML, CSS and JS. I was the HTML and CSS wasn't that much of a challenge but the JS was especially when it comes to applying concepts like arrays, functions, and loops. The copying of the color code using JS too was a challenge. But overall I got the job done.
